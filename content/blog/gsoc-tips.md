Google Summer of Code 2023 has been announced, and it's the perfect time to start preparing for your application. As a GSoC '22 contributor, I'd like to share some tips that I believe can increase your chances of getting selected for the program.

### 1\. Start Contributing Early:

This is my number one tip for maximizing your chances of getting selected for GSoC. Start contributing to the organization you want to apply for as early as possible. This gives you ample time to familiarize yourself with the codebase, set up the project environment, and contribute to the community.

### 2\. Be Active in the Community:

Being active in the community is essential to increase your chances of getting selected. Participate in forums, create issues on GitHub, make feature requests, and engage with other contributors. This will not only help you gain a deeper understanding of the project, but also show your genuine interest in the organization.

### 3\. Start with "Good First Issues" or "Easy" Issues:

Working with large codebases can be intimidating, but you can overcome this fear by starting with "good first issues" or "easy" issues listed in the project's "Issues" section. Solving these issues can boost your confidence and help you get a better understanding of the codebase.

### 4\. Use the App or Service:

Make sure to use the app or service that you want to contribute to. This way, you'll have a better understanding of the workflow and may even find new bugs or potential feature requests.

### 5\. Discuss Doubts with the Community:

If you have any doubts after browsing through the project list of the organization, don't hesitate to discuss them with the community. By doing this, you'll have a clearer picture of your project and be able to write a more comprehensive proposal.

### 6\. Don't Wait Until the Application Deadline:

This is an important tip that cannot be emphasized enough. Don't wait until the application deadline to submit your proposal draft. Instead, submit it early and seek feedback from mentors or other community members. This will give you time to refine your proposal and increase your chances of getting selected.

### 7\. Keep Contributing Even After Submitting Your Proposal:

Finally, keep contributing to the organization even after you submit your proposal. This shows your genuine interest in the project and increases your chances of getting selected.

## Conclusion

These are some tips that I believe can increase your chances of getting selected for Google Summer of Code 2023. I hope these tips are helpful and encourage you to start contributing early and actively participate in the community. If you found this blog post useful, please share it with others.
